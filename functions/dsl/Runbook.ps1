Set-StrictMode -Version 1.0;

<#
	SCOPE:
		- Wrapper for 1 or more Surfaces (along with other custom logic that might make sense)... 
		- Primarily an orchestrator - i.e., do THIS, then THIS, then THAT, etc... 

		- Specific Runbooks simply keep the list of Surfaces to process. 
		- At runtime, Runbooks are handled by the Execute-Runbook (internal) function. 
		- Execute-Runbook, in turn, is called by either: 
				> Evaluate-<RunbookName>
				> Provision-<RunbookName>
				> Document-<RunbbookName>
			and will do the requisite processing as needed... 


		- Execute-Runbook can also manage the notion of a 'NextRunbook' to process after successful completion of the current Surface. 
		- Likewise, Execute-Runbook will pass along an -AllowReboot switch (passed in from user/caller/scripts) that can be reviewed INSIDE of specific Runbook implementations.

	vNEXT:
		It _MIGHT_ make sense to have 3x phases of execution within a runbook, something equivalent to: 
			Prep (Open?), Run, Close - i.e., funcs/blocks that allow things like validation (Prep) and spin-up of resources (Prep), handle main execution, and .. do anything needed 'after'. 
			Only, while I can think of how something like this MIGHT make sense, I can't honestly think of any specific cases where I'd use and... 
			as such, it's just a COMPLICATION at this point. i.e., going MVP with a single 'main' body/func at this point, but can/could expand this later IF needed.
